Once the tap has been added locally, you can install individual software packages with: 
`$ brew install <formula>`

For example:
* Install the latest community version of MongoDB Server: `$ brew install mongodb-community`
* Install the latest community version of MongoDB Server 3.6 `$ brew install mongodb-community@3.6`
* Install the latest community shell for connecting to remote MongoDB instances: `$ brew install mongodb-community-shell`
